TITLE: Social Media API

DESCRIPTION: This is a an API similar to a social media API, it contains all CRUD operations, has verification schemas using pydantic. It also has authorization using OAuth2 authentication. This API also has a database integrated wiithin and uses alembic and sqlalchemy for major functions. Users are able to vote on posts and behaves like a typical social media platform where CRUD operations are limited to a user logged in and aren't able to perform some CRUD operations on posts that are not theirs. The testing of this API was tested with postman

Credits: The writing of this API was also assisted by freeCodeCamp (pyhton API), and the learning of python to this was by a book written by Eric Matthes (Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming)
